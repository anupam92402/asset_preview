Asset Preview

A project to help preview the assets for a Flutter/Dart project in one go.
Since Flutter or IDEs like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code do not provide a way to preview the assets, this project aims to provide a way to preview the assets.

It is a simple project built using Golang. It opens a browser window and displays the assets in a list with the file name and the image.

## How to use
1. Download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/nicks101/asset_preview/releases).
2. Run the binary in the root directory of the project. Or in the directory where the assets are located.

```bash
./asset-preview
```

3. Provide the path to the assets directory. If path is not provided, the program will look for the assets in the current directory.

```bash
./asset-preview -path="/path/to/assets"
```

4. An `preview_assets.html` file will be generated. It will open in the default browser.  
The file will be generated in the current directory.

**Note: Do not push this file to the version control.**


## How to build

2. Run the following command to build the binary.

3. Run the binary in the root directory of the project. Or in the directory where the assets are located.
